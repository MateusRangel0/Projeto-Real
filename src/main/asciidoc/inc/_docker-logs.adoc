== *docker:logs*

With this goal it is possible to print out the logs of containers
started from images configured in this plugin. By default only the
latest container started is printed, but this can be changed with a
property. The format of the log output is influenced by run
configuration of the configured images. The following system
properties can the behaviour of this goal:

.Logging options

|===
| Property | Description

| *docker.logAll*
| If set to `true` the logs of all containers created from images configured for this plugin are printed. The container id is then prefixed before every log line. These images can contain many containers which are already stopped. It is probably a better idea to use `docker logs` diretly from the command line.

| *docker.follow*
| If given will wait for subsequent log output until CRTL-C is pressed. This is similar to the behaviour of `docker logs -f` (or `tail -f`).

| *docker.filter*
| Filter to restrict the set of images for which log should be fetched. This can be a comma separated list of image or alias names.

| *docker.logDate*
| Date format to use. See "<<start-logging,Logging>>" for available formats.
